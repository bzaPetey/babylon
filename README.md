# Babylon.js Demos

As I learn new systems, I like to create a lot of smaller projects. I generally do not have them organized well, let a lone share them with anyone. Well this time around I thought I would try both. I am sure that I will turn this into a website down the road. I guess that site will have some babylon.js in it.

Hope it helps someone out. Enjoy

## Setup

This is an empty project that will be a good starting point for most projects that I am creating. Just copy this folder to a new spot and rename it.
